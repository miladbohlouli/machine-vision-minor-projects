Some well known machine vision algorithms utilization using opencv package

In this repository the following algorithms have been used as course projects for different applications:

1. HW1 contents
  1. Histogram Equalization
  2. Various versions of noises and smoothing methods
  3. Edge detection using Sobel, Canny ,and LoG operators
  4. Vertical and horizontal histogram calculation and character separation in car plates

2. HW2 contents
  1. The HoughLines algorithm in opencv for line detection
  2. The Houghcircles algoithm in opencv for circle detection
  3. Detecting the contours of the shapes in the provided image
  4. Circle detection using contours
  5. orientation detection using width and height of the detected rectangles

3.  Using Gabour kernels to classify the provided images among brick, rock and gravel

4. Firstly detecting keypoints using either BRISK or Harris corner detection and afterward face recognization using keypoint matching
